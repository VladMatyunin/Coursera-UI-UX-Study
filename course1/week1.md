# UI/UX basics

### Difference between UI and UX
- UI more about forming the content, how it should look like etc
    - Design driven
    - surface, visual identity
    - forming, look and feel, organization
- UX is about user behavior on site (navigation, interaction)
    - content, engagement
    - User driven
    - nav, story, structure

### UI tips
- real world knowledge. It is about analogues user does from real world (like buttons)
- learn befavior. 
- cause and effect (action and reaction). If button is pressed, something will happen.
- consistency (logic/systematic). If something is the same, it should work the same way. look same=behave similarly.
- seamless interaction (speed and ease). Few steps as possible. 
- immediate intuition. (know this button = know all buttons).
- fulfillment (payoff and results). pressed button -> expect something to happen.
- undo/redo. if a mistake done, help user to redo.
